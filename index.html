                <p class="assasinabout"> I’ve waited to try this one for a while now. It was originally due out at the end of 2020, but you can guess what happened. Regardless, it’s on track for this year now and I’m really interested to see how the gameplay ends up. Publisher Triton Noir made an excellent tactical stealth game with V-Commandos, so I know they have the chops to pull this one off. Assassin’s Creed – Brotherhood of Venice is billed as a cooperative minis game that is played out over a 26 mission campaign. You’ll be leveling up your assassin, taking on templars, and meeting many of the characters from the video game this one was inspired by. If it’s even half as good as V-Commandos, I’m all in.</p> </div>

                <p class="maglevabout"> While Ted Alspach is most known for Suburbia, Castles of Mad King Ludwig, and the Bezier Werewolf games, he also is one of the most prominent contributors to the classic train game, Age of Steam. He has designed over 20 expansions/maps for the system, so when I heard he was designing a new train game from his own company, I had to pay attention. Maglev Metro takes the traditional route building and deliveries seen in many train games and combines that with some unique ideas for the genre. The tiles are clear and can be stacked to overlap with different player’s track. And delivering robots to locations improve actions in almost an engine building manner (no pun intended). Maglev Metro seems to be a cool look at train games that could appeal to a wider crowd than most.</p></div>

                <p class="residentabout"> A while ago I missed out on backing Resident Evil 2 (based on the PS1 game) and had to collect it piece by piece. I didn’t miss out backing Resident Evil 3 this time around. Resident Evil 2 had a great, fast-paced action akin to Zombicide, but with amazingly flavorful boss fights and resource conservation, capturing the survival horror feeling quite well. Resident Evil 3 hopes to expand on that with a little more open-world gameplay and utilizing the stalking Nemesis creature to drive even more intense gameplay. The awesome looking miniatures are just the icing on the cake.</p></div>

                <p class="oathabout"> A couple of years ago designer Cole Wehlre and publisher Leder Games teamed up to bring us Root, one of the most successful wargames that somehow convinced the masses it was mainstream (at least as much as any hobby board game is mainstream). This year that duo is bringing us Oath, a tableau-building campaign game with some area control/wargaming type elements as well. If Root is a spin on the Coin wargame mechanisms, Oath is an evolution of Pax-series games. I’ve played it a couple of times on Tabletop Simulator but really looking forward to getting the physical game and getting a chance to see how the campaign elements work over multiple plays.</p></div>

                <p class="westabout"> Last year I discovered something about myself: I love worker placement games and I generally steer clear of expansions. Architects of the West Kingdom was my most played game last year and exclusively solo. So I was intrigued to learn on a whim that there is an expansion coming that will introduce six new solo opponents. There’s some other stuff that gets added to this game, but this is the thing that has me the most interested and excited about seeking this expansion out.</p></div>

        <header><h3 class="articletitle">Wingspan review</h3>
        <p class="published"> posted on  Jan 2, 2019 by Brian Biewer </p>        
        </header>
        <p class="wingspanreview"> Wingspan is an engine building/tableau card game for one to five players. Oh yeah… it is about birds. The game length varies based on number of players, but once you know the rules even four player games can be completed in an hour or less.<br>
           The game is played over four rounds, each of which lasts between five and eight turns. During a turn, the player chooses between four available actions: play a bird from your hand, gain food and activate the powers of birds in your forest, lay eggs and activate the powers of birds in your grasslands or draw cards and activate the powers of birds in your wetlands.<br>
           The best aspect of the game is the engine you build on your player board. When you take a forest, grasslands, or wetlands action, you get the resources that habitat provides and then activate every bird with a “when activated” power, in order from right to left. In addition, the more birds in play in a habitat, the more resources you receive.<br>
           All 170 bird cards have unique art as well as varied characteristics. If a bird has a power, it activates either when first played, when you use the action in the bird’s habitat, or when triggered by one of your opponent’s action.<br>
           Wingspan <em>completely</em> took me by surprise. It is, by far, my most played game of 2018. I simply cannot believe how much I love a game about birds. Wingspan appeals to me and what mechanisms I truly enjoy in my games. Tactical decisions. Tableau building. Variable end of round and end of game bonuses. Multiplayer solitaire (outside of the face up cards and some bird powers).</p>
